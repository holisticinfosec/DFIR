## The other DFIR: Deeper Functionality for Investigators with R

“To competently perform rectifying security service, two critical incident response elements are necessary: 
information & organization.” 
~ Robert E. Davis

*Deeper Functionality for Investigators with R*
- Incident responders and investigators need all the help they can get
- What concepts & methods further enable handlers & investigators as they continue to strive for faster detection and containment?
- Data science & visualization sure can’t hurt
- How can we be more creative to achieve “deeper functionality”? 

*DFIR Redefined Scenarios*
- Have you been pwned?
- Visualization for malicious Windows Event Id sequences
- How do your potential attackers feel, or can you identify an attacker via sentiment analysis?
- Fast Frugal Trees (decision trees) for prioritizing criticality

Presentation will be posted soon
